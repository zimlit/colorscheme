env:
  # TERM variable
  #
  # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
  # each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
  # check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
  # available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.

# Font configuration
font:
  # The normal (roman) font face to use.
  normal:
    family: "Source Code Pro" # should be "Menlo" or something on macOS.
    # Style can be specified to pick a specific face.
    style: Regular

  # The bold font face
  bold:
    family: "Source Code Pro" # should be "Menlo" or something on macOS.
    # Style can be specified to pick a specific face.
    style: Bold

  # The italic font face
  italic:
    family: "Source Code Pro" # should be "Menlo" or something on macOS.
    # Style can be specified to pick a specific face.
    style: Italic

  # Point size of the font
  size: 13

  # Offset is the extra space around each character. offset.y can be thought of
  # as modifying the linespacing, and offset.x as modifying the letter spacing.
  offset:
    x: 0
    y: 0

  # Glyph offset determines the locations of the glyphs within their cells with
  # the default being at the bottom. Increase the x offset to move the glyph to
  # the right, increase the y offset to move the glyph upward.
  glyph_offset:
    x: 0
    y: 0

  # Scale the font size based on the monitor's DPI. This will lead to bigger text on HiDPI
  # screens and make reading text a little easier.
  # On X11 it is possible to change the DPI for each instance of alacritty by using
  # `WINIT_HIDPI_FACTOR=1.0 alacritty` to scale the font.
  #scale_with_dpi: true

  # OS X only: use thin stroke font rendering. Thin strokes are suitable
  # for retina displays, but for non-retina you probably want this set to
  # false.
